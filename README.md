# Topology-Discovery

Create a distributed system consisting of n nodes arranged in a certain topology specified in a configuration file. 
Designed and implemented a distributed algorithm that enables each node to discover the entire network and identify its k-hop neighbors for each k. 
The algorithm eventually terminates at each node after which a node will output k-hop neighbors for each k.
